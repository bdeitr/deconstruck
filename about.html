	<div class="colonna1">The project aims to deconstruct and subvert the patriarchal and sexist imagery of truck drivers and the bias attached to them through Feminist <br>re-appropriation. 
This is done through a garment, a t-shirt intended here as a living and moving manifesto, capable of perpetual action of re-enactment. 
On the t-shirt, images of heavy goods vehicles are matched to feminist quotes by pivotal figures in the feminist and intersectional academic scene: Judith Butler, bell hooks, Sara Ahmed, and Angela Y. Davis. This juxtaposition generates a cultural and social crash, a short circuit that invites a reformulation of a cultural paradigm.</div>
	<div class="colonna1">Through the encounters with drivers, we intend to involve the direct addressee of the project, enabling them to take a position within the discourse. By talking to them we learn more and more about their social and professional figures and their lives.
Part of the income from the project is dedicated to the production of T-shirts that will be given as a gift to the truck drivers themselves, who if they wish will take part in this cultural redefinition by wearing it during their traveling.</div>
	<div class="colonna1">The style with which the graphics have been designed aims to gather up the vernacular visual heritage linked to the truck's imagery, valorizing it and putting it back into the arena within a transversal and experimental project. The playful manner in which the<br> t-shirts appear contrasts with the theoretical scope and complexity of the selected quotations.
By generating your own t-shirt you take part in an action in which you have your singular voice and duty. Therefore you support a sustainable production that follows a made-to-order model with an effort to reduce waste.</div>

<div class="ty">We thank Gerardo and Roberto, who first shared their truck drivers' stories with much kindness, and all the people who are supporting the project from the beginning <3
